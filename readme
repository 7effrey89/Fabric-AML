# Fabric-AML

**Microsoft Fabric and Azure Machine Learning integration**

## Overview

Fabric-AML provides resources and examples for integrating [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/) with [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/). This repository demonstrates how to connect data within Microsoft Fabric to Azure ML for advanced analytics, ML experiments, and deployment.

## Features

- Sample Jupyter Notebooks illustrating the end-to-end integration workflow
- Guidance on connecting to data in Microsoft Fabric from Azure ML
- Recipes for building, training, and scoring ML models using Fabric data
- Best practices for managing data and ML assets across both platforms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An active [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/) workspace
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Azure Machine Learning workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/)

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7effrey89/Fabric-AML.git
cd Fabric-AML
```

Install the required Python packages (see individual notebooks for specific requirements):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook(s) of interest.
2. Follow the instructions inside each notebook to configure credentials and connect to your Fabric and Azure ML workspaces.
3. Run the cells to see examples of data transfer, model training, and deployment.

## Example Notebooks

- **fabric_to_aml.ipynb**: Transfer data from Fabric and train a model in Azure ML.
- **aml_to_fabric.ipynb**: Deploy a model from Azure ML and visualize results in Fabric.
